Pantera, was an American heavy metal band from Arlington, Texas formed in 1981. The group's best-known lineup consisted of the Abbott brothers—drummer Vinnie Paul and guitarist Dimebag Darrell—along with vocalist Phil Anselmo and bassist Rex Brown. In addition to their development and popularization of the groove metal subgenre, Pantera is credited (along with others such as Testament, Sepultura and Machine Head) for being part of the second wave of thrash metal scene from the late 1980s to early-to-mid 1990s
Having started as a glam metal band, Pantera released three albums in the mid-1980s with founding member Terry Glaze as lead vocalist. Looking for a new and heavier sound, Pantera replaced Glaze with Anselmo in late 1986 and released Power Metal in 1988. The band secured a record deal with the major label Atco the following year. With its fifth album, 1990's Cowboys from Hell, Pantera popularized the groove metal genre, while its 1992 follow-up Vulgar Display of Power exhibited an even heavier sound. Far Beyond Driven (1994) debuted at number one on the Billboard 200.
